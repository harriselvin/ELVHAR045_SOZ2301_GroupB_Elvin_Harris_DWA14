# Tally App Challenge
In this challenge, you will be recreating the Tally App example using the Lit Framework. The goal is to demonstrate your proficiency with the Lit Framework and handle explicit states of the counter, including:

- Normal state
- Minimum reached state
- Maximum reached state

You are not required to use these exact terms for the states, but make sure to implement the necessary functionality to handle these states appropriately.

### Project Details
- Recreate the Tally App using the Lit Framework.
- Implement the counter component using Lit's LitElement base class.
- Use the html and css template literals provided by Lit for rendering and styling.
- The counter should display the current count value.
- The counter should have buttons to increment and decrement the count value.
- Handle the explicit states of the counter:
  - Normal state: The count value is within the valid range.
  - Minimum reached state: The count value reaches the minimum value.
  - Maximum reached state: The count value reaches the maximum value.
- Display appropriate alerts or messages when the minimum or maximum value is reached.
- Apply appropriate styling to the counter component.
- Use the provided CSS styles for the overall application layout.
- Consider using the Shoelace component library for additional UI elements (optional).
